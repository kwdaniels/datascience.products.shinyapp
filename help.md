# Pariveda Solutions Employee Growth Scenario Application

## Purpose
The executive team at Pariveda Solutions, Inc., would like to view employee growth scenarios for the years 2006 through 2016 given an initial employee count and a net annual growth rate. (Note: this is an actual real-world request.) This tool allows executive team members to enter an initial employee count at the beginning of 2016, then adjust the annual employee growth rate percentage to view the projected number of employees for each year through 2026 at the selected rate.

## How to Use this Application
- In the "Enter initial employee count" box, enter a numeric value representing the company employee head count at the beginning of year 2016. The initial employee count will default to 450 employees. (Note: If you enter a non-numeric or negative value, an initial value of 0 will be used, and no growth will occur over time.)
- On the slider beneath "Select annual growth rate percentage", click and hold the circle on the slider bar and drag it to the left or to the right to set the annual percentage growth rate to a desired value between -30% and 30%. The initial growth rate percentage will default to 15%.
- Whenever you make a change to either the "initial employee count" or to the "annual growth rate percentage", the chart on the right-hand size of the screen will immediately adjust to display the projected employee count for each year between 2016 and 2026 using the values you selected.
